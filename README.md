🚆 AI-Powered Smart Train Planner — Mumbai Local Railways

An intelligent crowd-aware system designed to make Mumbai Local train travel safer, smarter, and more efficient through real-time crowd monitoring, train occupancy insights, and congestion-aware travel guidance.

🌍 Why This Project?

Mumbai Locals carry 7.5+ million passengers daily — but face challenges like:

Extreme rush & overcrowding

Platform congestion & safety risks

Unpredictable peak-hour traffic

Lack of real-time visibility for commuters & authorities

Our system helps predict, monitor, and manage crowd flow across stations and trains.

💡 What the System Does

✔ Detects & monitors crowd density at stations and inside trains
✔ Provides live train occupancy status to commuters
✔ Predicts peak-hour congestion using AI
✔ Suggests safer alternative trains / routes
✔ Sends real-time alerts & notifications
✔ Supports authorities with dashboards & analytics
